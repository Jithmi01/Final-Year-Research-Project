  # New dependencies for the project:
  image_picker: ^1.0.4  # For selecting images for the People Manager
  # We use the latest stable versions for compatibility.
  # Note: The 'camera' package often requires platform-specific setup (Android/iOS).
  # camera: ^0.10.5+9 
  # For simplicity and to make the frontend run without platform setup errors initially, 
  # I'll omit the camera package here, but you should uncomment/add it later 
  # when you implement the live camera feed.

  # The following line is needed if you intend to use the images after picking them:
  # path_provider: ^2.1.1
